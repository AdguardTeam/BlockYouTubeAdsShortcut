# Block YouTube Ads in Safari on iPhone/iPad

This repository contains code for the shortcut that we use to block YouTube ads on iPhone/iPad.

The problem is that Safari Content Blocking capabilities is [not enough](https://adguard.com/en/blog/youtube-ads-in-safari-explained.html) to handle YouTube ads anymore. Our last resort is using iOS Shortcuts which require some additional manual actions.

## How to use this

1. Get the shortcut (TBD: insert link)
2. Open YouTube in Safari (it's important, it will only work in Safari)
3. Click the "Share button"
4. Choose "Block YouTube Ads (by AdGuard)" from the list of actions
5. Done! Now YouTube is ad free.

Please note, that every time you refresh the page, you need to run this shortcut again.
