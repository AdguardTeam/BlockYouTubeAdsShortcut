# Block YouTube Ads in Safari on iPhone/iPad

This repository contains code for the shortcut that we use to block YouTube ads on iPhone/iPad.

The problem is that Safari Content Blocking capabilities is [not enough](https://adguard.com/en/blog/youtube-ads-in-safari-explained.html) to handle YouTube ads anymore. Our last resort is using iOS Shortcuts which require some additional manual actions.

## How to use this

1. [Get the shortcut](https://agrd.io/ios_youtube_shortcut). In order to install it, you need to [allow untrusted shortcuts](https://www.macworld.com/article/233447/how-to-allow-untrusted-shortcuts-in-ios-13.html) first.
2. Open YouTube in Safari (it's important, it will only work in Safari)
3. Click the "Share button"
4. Choose "Block YouTube Ads (by AdGuard)" from the list of actions
5. You probably want to make this action "Favourite". Tap "Edit actions..." and then the "Plus" icon to do that.
6. Done! Now YouTube is ad free.

Please note, that every time you refresh the page, you need to run this shortcut again.
